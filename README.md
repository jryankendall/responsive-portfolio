## About
- Responsive-portfolio is an example website made for a homework assignment for February 4th, 2019 Vanderbilt Bootcamp Class. It's my Basic-Portfolio repository modified with media queries to be far more readable on smaller viewports such as those on a tablet or phone. Learned about SASS/SCSS and decided to use it for building my CSS.
